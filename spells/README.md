# Spells

## Purpose of the Folder
This folder contains all magical spells, rituals, and supernatural abilities available in the Shadows of the City role-playing game system. Spells are organized as individual files for easy reference and modification.

## Approach/Methodology
Spells are designed with the following principles:
- **Urban Fantasy Integration**: Spells work within the technological and social context of the Golden Age setting
- **Geflecht Mechanics**: All spells interact with the world's magical fabric system
- **Technological Interference**: Modern technology can affect or be affected by magical spells
- **Balance**: Spells are balanced against each other and the game's power level
- **Flavor**: Each spell includes thematic elements specific to the Shadows of the City world

## Dependencies
- Core game mechanics (defined in the `rules` folder)
- Character classes and their spellcasting abilities
- The world's magical fabric system and its current state
- Technological infrastructure and its interaction with magic

## Important Notes
- All spells should consider the world's current magical state (damaged by atomic weapons)
- Spells may behave differently in areas with strong or weak magical fabric
- Modern technology can interfere with or be affected by magical effects
- Consider the social implications of magic use in a world where it's officially suppressed
